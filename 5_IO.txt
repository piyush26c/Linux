*****STANDARD OUTPUT REDIRECTING*****

1] $cat 
#tells us about the standard input stream which is bydefault keyboard

2] Two ways to get data in are : Standard Input Stream, option argument
and two ways to get data out : Standard Output Stream, Standard Error Stream.

3] $cat 1> output.txt
<type the text and press Ctrl+c>
#redirects the standard output stream to file name output.txt located in current directory, moreover 1 is option means : 
$cat > output.txt
#above to two commands truncate the file, whereas if you want to append the data enterec you have to type '>>' I mean :
$cat >> output.txt, will actually append the data you have entered so far....
